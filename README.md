## ✨ Key Features
- 🔬 A deep learning model called iAFP-fLRM is developed for identification of Antifungal Peptide.

- 🧬 Multiple features of sequences were extracted by integrating word embeddings with handcrafted feature functions.

- 📊 The incorporation of residual connections in the classifier enhanced the representational capacity of the network.

- 📈 An LSTM architecture was utilized to integrate multiple features, thereby generating highly discriminative representations.
